BetterPerformance

BetterPerformance is an entirely open-source and transparent web application designed to optimize your system using native Windows scripts like Regedit, PowerShell, or Batch files. The application allows users to apply various tweaks and optimizations by downloading scripts generated based on data from our database.
Features

    Regedits Management: Create, update, or delete Regedit entries using the regeditID. This allows for precise control over the tweaks applied to your system.
    Entry and Path Management: Add new entries or paths to your Regedits using the regeditID. This functionality is currently the most stable part of the application.
    Index-Free Management: We've removed the reliance on INDEX for managing Regedits to avoid index-related issues in React. This ensures smoother and more reliable functionality.
